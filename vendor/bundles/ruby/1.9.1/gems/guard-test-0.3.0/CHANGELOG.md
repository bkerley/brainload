### Bugs fixes:

- Fixed bug that was preventing tests from running. ([@rymai][])
- Fixed the `fastfail` runner that was displaying a green dot even for a failing test. ([@rymai][])
- Removed the `:notification` option. Use the new Guard method instead. ([@rymai][])

### New features:

- Turn seems to work fine now... ([@rymai][])

### Improvement:

- Consider 'test_*.rb' as test files as well. ([@uk-ar][])

## 0.3.0.rc4 - June 3, 2011 - ([@rymai][])

### Bugs fixes:

- Add a require that was making the guard be fired by Guard! :'(

## 0.3.0.rc3 - June 3, 2011 - ([@rymai][])

### Bugs fixes:

- Actually make the tests run.

### Regression:

- Turn doesn't want to run, so remove sentences that say that it is supported for now. Note: The code is still here, only the command line doesn't seem to output anything...

## 0.3.0.rc2 - June 2, 2011 - ([@rymai][])

### New features:

- New `:cli` option (nil by default) to pass arbitrary CLI arguments to the Ruby/Turn command that runs the tests.
- New `:notification` option (true by default) to disable notification (Growl/Inotify).
- New `:all_on_start` option (true by default) to not run all the tests at startup.
- New `:all_after_pass` option (true by default) to run all tests after changed tests pass.
- New `:keep_failed` option (true by default) to keep failed tests until them pass.

### Improvement:

- Added compatibility with 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.2, REE, Rubinius and JRuby.
- Internal changes inspired by [guard-minitest](https://github.com/guard/guard-minitest).
